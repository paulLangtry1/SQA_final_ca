# Software Quality Assurance Project Plan #
## Introduction ## 

As part of a Software Quality management plan for an organisation you have been asked to implement an example software project. This will be a reference guide for best practices that the rest of the team can refer to. The project will demonstrate the following topics:

1. Scrum sprint backlog and task estimation
2. Unit testing and Test-Driven development
3. Test coverage metric
4. Team version-control 


## Sprint Backlog & Task Estimation ##
While reviewing code made by you or your colleagues there are generally a few questions you can ask yourself about the code.

| Sprint | Center aligned  | Right aligned  |
|:-------------|:---------------:|---------------:|
| Second cell  | Third cell      | fourth cell    |
| foo          | **strong**      | baz            |
| quux         | baz             | bar            |
|              |                 |                |
||              |                 |                |
|-----------------+--------------+-----------------+----------------|
