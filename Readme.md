# Software Quality Assurance Project Plan #
## Introduction ## 

As part of a Software Quality management plan for an organisation you have been asked to implement an example software project. This will be a reference guide for best practices that the rest of the team can refer to. The project will demonstrate the following topics:

1. Scrum sprint backlog and task estimation
2. Unit testing and Test-Driven development
3. Test coverage metric
4. Team version-control
